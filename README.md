## Things to Do
- [ ] Format B Instruction
    - [ ] Reset needs to be redone - should be a specific signal to flush buffer contents, not reset everything
    - [ ] Move the PC calculation into decode stage? 
    - [ ] OUT_PORT needs to be moved (could output before branch decision is made). Would be fine if PC calc is done in decode
    - [ ]
- [ ] Format L Instructions
- [ ] Data Hazards
- Others
    - [ ] Change PC to 16 bit (idk why I thought it was 6 bit)
    - [ ] Get data addressing for ROM/RAM mapped
